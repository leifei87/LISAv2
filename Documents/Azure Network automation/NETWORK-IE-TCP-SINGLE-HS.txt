Login on your Hyper-V server.

Start PowerShell with the Run As Administrator option.

Deploy VM's in Azure.
	1.	Create deployment of type : Internal Endpoint Single Hosted Service.
		You will get Two VMs deployed in a hosted service.
		VM alias : HS1VM1, HS1VM2
		Hosted Service Alias : HS1
		[please go through DEPLOYMENT-CONFIGURATIONS.txt for more information about deploy types.]
	
Execute Test :
	1. 	Start Iperf Server on HS1VM1 in TCP mode.
		Execute "iperf -s -p <port number>"
		<port number> can be any random port. (e.g 534, 650, ..)
	2.	Start iperf Client on HS1VM2 in TCP mode.
		Execute "iperf -c <DIP of HS1VM1 role> -p <port number>"
	3.	Verify that iperf server is receiving data from iperf client.
	4.	Start iperf Client on HS1VM2 in TCP mode with hostname.
		Execute "iperf -c <Hostname of HS1VM1 role> -p <port number>"
	5.	Verify that iperf server is receiving data from iperf client.
	6.	If DIP and Hostname scenarios are successful, Mark the test as PASS.
	
Cleanup the test VMs.
	1.	If test is PASS, delete all VMs under test. 
	2.	If test is FAIL, collect the logs and preserve deployed VMs.

Add following test definition under "<testsDefinition>..</testsDefinition>" in XML file to drive the test:
    <test>
		<testName>NETWORK-IE-TCP-SINGLE-HS</testName>
		<testScript></testScript>
		<testScriptps1>NETWORK-IE-TCP-SINGLE-HS.ps1</testScriptps1>
		<files>remote-scripts\start-server.py, remote-scripts\start-client.py, remote-scripts\check-server.py, remote-scripts\azuremodules.py</files>
		<setupType>IEndpointSingleHS</setupType>
		<TestType></TestType>
		<TestFeature></TestFeature>
		<TestMode>IP,Hostname</TestMode>
		<Priority>P0</Priority>
    </test>
 	
Run the tests defined in the .xml file.
           From the PowerShell command line, issue the following command:
           Run all NETWORK tests:
.\AzureAutomationManager.ps1 -xmlConfigFile azure_ica_all.xml -runtests -Distro CentOS -cycleName NETWORK

Deploy VM's in Azure.
	1.	Create deployment of type : Internal Endpoint Single Hosted Service.
		You will get Two VMs deployed in a hosted service.
		VM alias : HS1VM1, HS1VM2
		Hosted Service Alias : HS1
		[please go through DEPLOYMENT-CONFIGURATIONS.txt for more information about deploy types.]
	
Execute Test :
	1. 	Login to HS1VM1.
	2.	Try to ping HS1VM2 with DIP of HS1VM2.
		Execute "ping <DIP of HS1VM2> -s <Packet Size>"
		<Packet Size> could be 100, 300, 500, ..
	3.	Verify that ping is successful.
	4.	Try to ping HS1VM2 with Hostname of HS1VM2.
		Execute "ping <Hostname of HS1VM2> -s <Packet Size>"
	5.	Verify that ping is successful.
	6.	Repeat the test for different Packet Sizes.
	7.	If DIP and Hostname scenarios are successful for all tested Packet Sizes, then mark test as PASS.

	
Cleanup the test VMs.
	1.	If test is PASS, delete all VMs under test. 
	2.	If test is FAIL, collect the logs and preserve deployed VMs.

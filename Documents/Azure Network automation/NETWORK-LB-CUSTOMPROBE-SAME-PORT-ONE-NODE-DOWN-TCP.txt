Login on your Hyper-V server.

Start PowerShell with the Run As Administrator option.

Deploy VM's in Azure.
	1.	Create deployment of type : Load Balanced - Probe Port on same port.
		You will get Two VMs deployed in a hosted service.
		VM alias : HS1VM1, HS1VM2
		Hosted Service Alias : HS1
		[please go through DEPLOYMENT-CONFIGURATIONS.txt for more information about deploy types.]
	
Execute Test :
	1. 	Start Iperf server on HS1VM1
		Execute "iperf -s -p <TCP load balanced port>"
	2. 	Start Iperf server on HS1VM2
		Execute "iperf -s -p <TCP load balanced port>"
	3.	Wait until you see probe messages on both iperf servers.
	4. 	Start Iperf client on dtap machine (A machine outside Azure, which have a static IP address).
		Execute "iperf -c <VIP of HS1> -p <TCP load balanced port> -P 2"
	5.	Verify HS1VM1 and HS1VM2 connected to One connection each. And data transfer is evenly distributed.
	6.	Stop iperf server on HS1VM1.
		Execute "killall iperf" on HS1VM1 and wait 20 seconds.
	7.	Start Iperf client on dtap machine.
		Execute "iperf -c <VIP of HS1> -p <TCP load balanced port> -P 2"
	8.	Verify that HS1VM1 is not receiving any connection. And HS1VM2 connected to 2 connections.
	9.	Verify that data transfer between iperf server and client is successful.
	10. Start Iperf server on HS1VM1
		Execute "iperf -s -p <TCP load balanced port>"
	12.	Wait until you see probe messages on both iperf servers.
	13.	Start Iperf client on dtap machine (A machine outside Azure, which have a static IP address).
		Execute "iperf -c <VIP of HS1> -p <TCP load balanced port> -P 2"
	14.	Verify HS1VM1 and HS1VM2 connected to One connection each. And data transfer is evenly distributed.
	15.	Repeat 1 - 14 using DNS name of VM roles.
		Hint : Execute "iperf -c <DNS name of HS1> -p <TCP load balanced port> -P 2" on Dtap machine.

Cleanup the test VMs.
	1.	If test is PASS, delete all VMs under test. 
	2.	If test is FAIL, collect the logs and preserve deployed VMs.

Add following test definition under "<testsDefinition>..</testsDefinition>" in XML file to drive the test:
    <test>
		<testName>NETWORK-LB-CUSTOMPROBE-SAME-PORT-ONE-NODE-DOWN-TCP</testName>
		<testScript></testScript>
		<testScriptps1>NETWORK-LB-CUSTOMPROBE-SAME-PORT-ONE-NODE-DOWN-TCP.ps1</testScriptps1>
		<files>remote-scripts\start-server.py, remote-scripts\start-client.py, remote-scripts\check-server.py, remote-scripts\azuremodules.py,remote-scripts\start-server-without-stopping.py, remote-scripts\stop-server.py, remote-scripts\stop-client.py</files>
		<setupType>CustomProbeSamePort</setupType>
		<TestType></TestType>
		<TestFeature></TestFeature>
		<TestMode>VIP,URL</TestMode>
    </test>

 	
Run the tests defined in the .xml file.
           From the PowerShell command line, issue the following command:
           Run all NETWORK tests:
.\AzureAutomationManager.ps1 -xmlConfigFile azure_ica_all.xml -runtests -Distro CentOS -cycleName NETWORK

Login on your Hyper-V server.

Start PowerShell with the Run As Administrator option.

Make sure that you have set-up a Virtual Network (VNET) environment first.
	If not you didn't setup VNET, then please go through SETUP-VNET-TEST-ENVIRONMENT.txt.
	
Deploy VM's in VNET as following:
		Hosted Service 1                          Hosted Service 2
			   |                                          |
		VM1-----------VM2                       VM3---------------VM4  
	 (Subnet1)      (Subnet2)                (Subnet2)         (Subnet1)

Configure DNS server with newly deployed Virtual Machine details.
	Please see 	CONFIGURE-VNET-DNS-SERVER.txt
	
Execute Test :
	SSH TEST :
	1.	From VM in Customer Site, do ssh to VM1 in VNET using DIP of VM1. Verify that you can successfully log in to VM2 and execute some commands.
	2.	Verify above scenario for VM2, VM3 and VM4.
	3.	From VM in Customer Site, do ssh to VM1 in VNET using Hostname of VM1. Verify that you can successfully log in to VM2 and execute some commands.
	4.	Verify above scenario for VM3 and VM4.
	SCP TEST
	1.	From VM in Customer Site, do scp file copy to VM1 in VNET using DIP of VM1. Verify that file is copied successfully.
	2. 	Repeat above step for VM2, VM3 and VM4.
	3.	From VM in Customer Site, do scp file copy to VM1 in VNET using Hostname of VM1. Verify that file is copied successfully.
	4.	Repeat above step for VM2, VM3 and VM4.
	Verify that all SSH and SCP scenarios are successful.
	
Cleanup the test VMs.
	1.	If test is PASS, delete all VMs under test. 
	2.	If test is FAIL, collect the logs and preserve deployed VMs.

Edit the XML file used to drive the test

      <testName>VNET-VERIFY-REMOTE-SSH-SCP-LOCAL-TO-VNET-ACCESS</testName>
      <testScript></testScript>

    </test>

	
Run the tests defined in the .xml file.
            From the PowerShell command line, issue the following command:
           Run all VNET tests:
.\AzureAutomationManager.ps1 -xmlConfigFile azure_ica_all.xml -runtests -Distro CentOS -cycleName VNET

Login on your Hyper-V server.

Start PowerShell with the Run As Administrator option.

Make sure that you have set-up a Virtual Network (VNET) environment first.
	If not you didn't setup VNET, then please go through SETUP-VNET-TEST-ENVIRONMENT.txt.
	
Deploy VM's in VNET as following:
		Hosted Service 1                          Hosted Service 2
			   |                                          |
		VM1-----------VM2                       VM3---------------VM4  
	 (Subnet1)      (Subnet2)                (Subnet2)         (Subnet1)

Configure DNS server with newly deployed Virtual Machine details.
	Please see 	CONFIGURE-VNET-DNS-SERVER.txt
	
Execute Test :
	1.	On VM1, execute "ping <DIP of VM2>". Verify that ping is successful.
	2. 	Repeat above step of DIP of VM3 and VM4.
	3.	On VM1, execute "ping <Hostname of VM2>". Verify that ping is successful.
	4.	Repeat above step of Hostname of VM3 and VM4.
	5.	If all ping scenarios are successful, then mark test as PASS.
	
Cleanup the test VMs.
	1.	If test is PASS, delete all VMs under test. 
	2.	If test is FAIL, collect the logs and preserve deployed VMs.

Edit the XML file used to drive the test
 <test>
      <testName>VNET-PING-INTRAVNET-ACCESS</testName>
      <testScript></testScript>
      <testScriptps1>VNET-PING-INTRAVNET-ACCESS.ps1</testScriptps1>
      <files>remote-scripts\azuremodules.py,remote-scripts\ConfigureDnsServer.py,remote-scripts\CleanupDnsServer.py,remote-scripts\ConfigureResolvConf.py,remote-scripts\RunSSHCmd.py,remote-scripts\RemoteCopy.py,remote-scripts\ping.py</files>

      <SubtestValues>SameHS-DiffSubnet,DiffHS-SameSubnet,DiffHS-DiffSubnet</SubtestValues>
      <TestMode>DIP,Hostname</TestMode>
    </test>
	
Run the tests defined in the .xml file.
            From the PowerShell command line, issue the following command:
           Run all VNET tests:
.\AzureAutomationManager.ps1 -xmlConfigFile azure_ica_all.xml -runtests -Distro CentOS -cycleName VNET
